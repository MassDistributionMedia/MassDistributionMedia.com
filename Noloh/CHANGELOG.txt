NOLOH 1.7.688 - 1.7.690 posted Mon, May 16th, 2011 at 5:00 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- iPad Detection Fix: The recent addition of multiple mobile devices incorrectly addressed the iPad as a mobile device, rather than a slate device.

- ListView FALSE Column Contraints: Binding a ListView to a defined set of
  columns with a callback would result in an error if the columns had a false
  column constraint, such as array(false, 'My Col'). This is now fixed, along
  with allowing you to do $columns['My Col'] = 'some data''; in your callback,
  if you wanted to pass $columns to the ListViewItem constructor, rather than
  doing your own SubItems->Add.


NOLOH 1.7.678  - 1.7.688 posted Thu, May 12th, 2011 at 5:57 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- ListView Style Changes: More efficient default styling for ListView
- Minor DataReader Improvements: Minor changes to how DataReader determines an intersection for objects that Bind to data sets with constraints.
- RolloverTab SetSelected to null: You can now set RolloverTab's Selected to NULL. Doing so will remove the Selected state from your RolloverTab. For example, if you wanted to have an Out, Over, and Down state, but without the permanent selection or need to toggle once selected.
- ControlPair Improvements: Several minor improvements, including improved Layout::Relative support. When adding ControlPairs to a container you can now set the ControlPairs layout to Layout::Relative and they'll stack on top of each other rather than appearing to the left of each other.

NEW FEATURES

- More MobileAppURL and Mobile App Include: 
- MobileAppURL Configuration property: Allows a developer to specify a URL that a mobile user will be redirected to for their mobile-specific app.
- Mobile-specific app: The MobileApp interface allows a developer to specify that their WebPage is meant to be a mobile-specific app.
- UserAgent Mobile detection: UserAgent class now detects (and has corresponding constants) for various mobile devices including iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm, WindowsMobile, and other proprietary mobile devices.
- Documentation Improvements: Minor improvements to various class function documentation
- ListView Improvements: Several minor and major improvements to ListView:

1. Ability to use callback with null columns (makes all columns available in $BoundData without having to specify which columns you want to bind to, however, using this approach you would either have to use all columns, or specify the columns you want in your callback) 
2. Ability to have null column values, without messing up column order
3. Ability to use non-displayed columns anywhere in column order, i.e. array(id, false) in the middle of your columns
4. Several speed improvements
5. Minor revisions to default look and feel
6. Column headings take up full column-width, allowing for left, center, and right alignment
7. Improved row rendering and styling

NOLOH 1.7.658 - 1.7.663 posted Mon, Feb 28th, 2011 at 2:39 AM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Improved Compatibility with 3rd Party Libraries and Frameworks: Previously when working with 3rd Party PHP Libraries or Frameworks that included their own auto include handler, without __autoinclude NOLOH would throw an sometimes throw an error when attempting to access or use the library/framework. To workaround this you would often have to manually include the necessary files.

This patch corrects this and allows you to use use 3rd party libraries or frameworks that have their own auto includes via System::IncludePaths or via the 3rd party's directions without any errors or prompts.
- MarkupRegion & RichMarkupRegion Improvements: Minor improvements to the way MarkupRegion and RichMarkupRegion render.
- Improved Support for SubItem CSS class additions: Fixed issue where adding a user-defined CSS class to a ListViewItem's SubItem would not take effect.

NOLOH 1.7.650 - 1.7.658 posted Mon, Feb 21st, 2011 at 4:58 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Missing Image: Fixed issue where NOLOH was unable to find TabPanel's default close image when the TabPage is closeable.
- RolloverImage Path + Other: Corrected RolloverImage's Path to properly fetch the correct path. Also made some minor documentation improvements
- URL Token String: Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the URL to end with more than one consecutive / characters.
- Undefined property error: Previously, setting some types of client-side properties that didn't have exact server-side corresponding properties would cause an error.
- _NSet and ClientScript::Set respects namespaces: When using ClientScript::Set, or _NSet with a custom namespace, for example, ClientScript::Set($this, 'SomeProp', 'value', 'CustomSpace'), NOLOH would try to call a corresponding function SetCustomSpace.SomeProp of your object, instead of SetSomeProp of your object. This is now corrected and works with as many namespace chains as you like.
- Modal Background Improvements: When using System::Modal without a container the Modal's background will remain fixed to the WebPage.
- Improved Log Window: When using System::Log in certain browsers the log window would show extra scrollbars unnecessarily.
- Improved Handling for Quotes when using ClientScript functions: In certain situations using quotes inside text passed to JavaScript would result in an error.

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Various Client Improvements: Implements several changes that should further increase the client side performance of NOLOH applications.
- Improvements to ControlPair: When using ControlPair with Labels or complex controls such as DatePicker the ControlPair would not always orient itself properly. ControlPair now orients itself properly both horizontally and vertically in these situations.
- Better RaceQueue and RaceClientEvent: Major improvements to Race condition handling. Both RaceQueue and RaceClientEvent's conditional can be comprised of tiered namespaces in addition to tiered namespace conditionals. This allows for even better interaction with complex third party JavaScript libraries.


NOLOH 1.7.638  - 1.7.644 posted Tue, Jan 11th, 2011 at 2:54 AM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Error handling: If your application successfully started, and then the original running file (the one that usually contains the WebPage class) is broken with a parser error without restarting the application, then this parser error used to not properly alert the details.
- Error handling: Parse errors under certain specific situations would sometimes cease to display in PHP 5.3

- CollapsePanel Title Improvements: CollapsePanel's TitleBackground is deprecated in favor of a new Title InnerObject. This allows you to set BackColor and other properties directly on the Title object.
- Typing in TextBoxes in Opera: Would result in a JavaScript error under certain conditions.

NEW FEATURES

- Use return of client function in ClientScript::Set: When using ClientScript::Set you can now specify the return of a ClientScript or ClientEvent/RaceClientEvent as a value. For example, ClientScript::Set($this, 'Map', new RaceClientEvent('google.maps', 'new google.maps.Map')

This allows for easier wrapping and integration of 3rd party client libraries and widgets.
- ClientScript::Raw: When using ClientScript functions or ClientEvents you can now wrap arguments or strings with ClientScript::Raw to send the string or argument to the client unadulterated. This is useful for when passing closures to the client, or when you want to specify an Object.

NOLOH 1.7.619 - 1.7.625 posted Fri, Oct 8th, 2010 at 3:11 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- ListControl Bind: Added and documented Bind for all ListControls. Removed Bind from ComboBox due to inheriting Bind from ListControl.
- NOLOH error handling system: Many improvements to the way that NOLOH deals with serious syntactical errors, such as parser or fatal errors. In particular, if error reporting suggests to not report such errors, they will now not report. Conversely, it should now always show if the setting is on, whereas this setting was previously not used. Among other benefits, this fixes a previous bug where in certain situations, an introduction of a syntactical error will cause a white screen with no details.
- E_USER_NOTICE dependency: Previous versions of NOLOH relied on error reporting settings to enable errors of type E_USER_NOTICE for NOLOH's error handling system to catch errors of very different, much more serious types (e.g., parse or syntax errors)
- Fixed some errors/notices: That are generated by the kernel when all error reporting is on.
- Significantly improved auto-detect of NOLOH path: This especially applies to Windows-based servers. It greatly reduces the number of cases that modifying NOLOHConfig.php is necessary for a custom path string, and should allow simply including NOLOH to be sufficient on most, common environments.

NEW FEATURES

- System::GetRelativePath optional $slash param: It allows one to specify which slash (forward or backward) should be used in the returned string. The default, System::Auto, picks the slash character that is preferred by the server operating system.

- Object clean-up: The Object class code has been significantly cleaned up, additionally adding a possible, negligible performance increase.

NEW FEATURES

- SpiderSSL Configuration setting: Allows a developer to specify whether search engine spiders should be forcefully redirected to a URL with a http or https protocol. Defaults to redirecting to 'http', and a value of System::Auto does not redirect at all, which was the previous behavior.

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- CSS File Redundancy: Fixed issue where calling WebPage's CSSFiles->Add on a previously added would unnecessarily resend the file to the client.
- SQL Generation Bug with more than 9 replacements: Fixed bug where using CreateCommand or ExecSQL with more than 9 replacements would replace incorrectly.
- Link href: The href of a Link to search engines now reflects more accurately the desired, more canonical URL.
- Image Text and alt attribute: Image's Text now corresponds to the client-side "alt" attribute for search engines. It may be set to blank string if no alt is desired, but defaultly, it will choose an alt string based on various properties, e.g., Path.
- Configuration and AutoStart: Changes that, under certain circumstances, make the Configuration instance considered earlier in the chain of execution than previously, allowing it to affect more core behaviors.

NEW FEATURES

- Canonical URLs: NOLOH will automatically figure out where duplication of content occurs based on redundant token usage, and display a directive to search engine spiders that will indicate all those different URLs point to the same content.
- ShowURLFilename: A new Configuration parameter that allows one to specify whether he would like the application's filename (e.g., index.php) to appear along with the representations of its URLs, especially of relevance to search engine spiders.
- System::HTTPError: New method that allows a special HTTP message code to be sent to search engine spiders, or optionally redirect normal users to a specified URL
- URL::IsSpider: New method for checking if the user is a search engine spider.

- Tab SEO Improvements: Improvements to Tab's rendering for search engines.
- Binding to DataCommand not working with MySQL: Fixed bug where binding to a MySQL DataCommand would not show your data.
- Major Improvements to ListView: Significant performance improvements, including column resize and sorting. 

ListViewItem can now have a height of null so that your row will fit your column's contents.

ListViewItems' SubItems are no longer tied to columns so you can have a SubItem in your ListViewItem that doesn't show if the associated column isn't added yet.
- Inaccurate paths: Sometimes "//" would be sent to browsers when "/" was meant for fetching assets (like Images) provided by NOLOH.

NEW FEATURES

- System::Modal(): System::Modal() allows you to Modal an object. You can specify the parent container, BackColor, Duration and Opacity of the Modal. If no container is specified your object will Modal in WebPage by default.

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Shifts Percent Constraint Improvements: Shift With functions now can also take in a percentage constraint for max/min.
- Link Tokens: Whereas before tokens set on a Link object were understood as changes to the application's current token state, each Link now starts with no tokens as a base. Note that an upcoming patch will give the developer the ability to choose the desired behavior.
- IEnavigation bug: In certain versions of Internet Explorer, whennavigating around in a NOLOH app either by the back button, refreshing,or modifying the address bar directly or via proprietary JavaScript,certain primitive Components such as Timers were previously notcorrectly removed.
- ArrayListContains bug: The ArrayList method Contains had a bug where thecorrect value would not be returnedsometimes.
- TabPanel Scroller Improvments: When using TabPanel with TabScrolling set true and there are more tabs then room in the TabScroller the TabScroller displays Back/Next buttons to scroll the tabs. Now when these tabs are closed and there's enough room to remove the Scrolling buttons, the TabBar will snap back and orient itself so that you can see all the tabs.
- Clientside Outer Function Improvements: NOLOH's client outer dimension functions now toggle an object's display if necessary in order to get the true dimensions of the object.
- Visibleproperty of Controls: Whereas before the possible values forVisible were true, false, or System::Vacuous, not it can be true, false,or System::Cloak. The interpretation of true remains unchanged but thenew meaning of false is the same as the old System::Vacuous, meaningthat the Control will be invisible and not take up any space, and themeaning of System::Cloak is the old meaning of false, namely that theControl will be invisible but still take up space in the sense ofrelative layouts.

NEW FEATURES

- CSSClassesArrayList: Added the ArrayList CSSClasses to every Control sothat new classes may be added via ->CSSClasses->Add as opposed to havingto append to the string-based space-delimited CSSClassproperty.
- ArrayListToggle method: Added the Toggle method to ArrayList, which Addsan element if it is not already present, or Removes it if it ispresent.
- Integrated debugging now works in IDEs: When using an IDE to debug your NOLOH applications you can now use the IDEs integrated debugging allowing you to use breakpoints, watch,locals, etc.
- Shifts Percent Constraint: Sometimes when using Shifts[] the use of a percentage for max/min constraints can be useful. Now you can use a percentage as a max/min constraint for a direct shift. The percentage is dynamic and is useful for scalable interfaces.

- Groupclient-side Remove: Allows elements from a Group to be Removedwithout the need to visit theserver.
- TreeList Modifications: TreeList now uses MarginLeft instead of Left for horizontal positioning. Modification of TreeList client functions to allow a node to be selected without needing NOLOH to pass in the TreeNode's element.
- MinorAnimation JavaScript correction: Animation JavaScripts are givena slightly more correct syntax, which has no noticeable effect in mostcases. It is mostly done to comply with standards ofcorrectness.
- HTMLcompliance: A very minor basic change to increase strictcompliance with HTML 4.01.
- Separationof XHR: Improvement JavaScript code dealing with theXMLHTTPRequest object. It is now more modular and separated, and willnot use ActiveX object for newer versions of IE that support itnatively.
- SEO: Numerousimprovements are made to the engine NOLOH uses to generate code to asearch engine.
- Internalcookies: Cookies that are used by the kernel are handled in abetter way, which should imrpove both stability and performancethroughout all stages of applicationuse.
- MiscLink improvements: Improved various Link behaviors such as howit was sometimes displayed with underlines if a Control is used insteadof Text, or how using Opacity was sometimes incorrectly rendered bybrowsers.
- CSSReset: 
- ClientScript::Set with namespaces: UsingClientScript::Set together with namespaces did not always work correctly in cases where the namespace did not alreadyexist.
- Leave bug: The Leave method did not always workin cases where an object was not Added to an ArrayList property called"Controls"
- Buoyant and garbage collection: The garbagecollection of certain Controls would sometimes lead to a JavaScript error when those objects were to be moved as aresult of the Buoyant property.
- Panel constructor and Sets: Modifiedthe Panel constructor to not call SetWidth and SetHeight methods if nulls are passed in, consistent with how someother classes behave. This removes some potential for race conditions introduced by some complex extensions of thatclass if the developer was not very careful.
- Notices: Fixed a number of notices thrown bythe kernel seen when PHP error_reporting is sufficiently high.
- Group initial Clear bug: Fixed an issuewhere if elements were Added to a Group, then it was Cleared, and other elements Added before the Group evenShows, the latest elements would not group themselves correctly.

- Panel Width/Height can be System::Auto: System::Auto now works for Panel. When objects are added the Panel will resize automatically according to the object's size and position.

This eliminates Panel's Stretches property.
- Documenting MarkupRegion InnerCSSClass: Documentation for MarkupRegion's InnerCSSClass
- MarkupRegion InnerCSSClass: MarkupRegion has a new Property InnerCSSClass that allows you to set a CSSClass on the contents of the MarkupRegion. This allows for things like a Margin around the contents.
- ArrayListContains method: Returns whether or not an element is in theArrayList.
- Listener: TheListener Control allows a developer to listen to some data source andwhen a change in it is detected, the object's Update Event isautomatically called for you. Thus, it is NOLOH's implementation ofserver push or "Comet" technology. Please read the upcoming articlefor more information.
- ClientScript::Observe: ClientScript::Observeallows you to watch a JavaScript property of an object on the client andreport changes to that object to the server either in its original nameor through an optional aliasparameter.
- All sugar: Allows the same action to bedone on every element of an Iterable object (such as an ArrayList) by prepending that property assignment or methodcall with "All"
- InnerSugar: Allows a developer to definecustom inner properties as a syntactic sugar on that class as an alternative to defining many helperclasses.


NOLOH 1.7.514 - 1.7.522 posted Fri, Apr 30th, 2010 at 4:00 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Missing Blank.gif for IE6: IE6's transparent .png support was missing the necessary Blank image. 
- null to MarkupRegion constructor: Now ifnull is passed as the Text to a MarkupRegion's constructor, a call to SetText will simply not be made,analogous with the behavior of passing in null to any Controls' size parameters in the constructor. Withoutthis, overloading SetText sometimes lead to unintentional behavior when this subtlety was not taken intoconsideration by a developer.
- Opacity to 100: Setting a Control'sOpacity to 100 used to sometimes lead to a small visual glitch in the way some browsers rendered thatControl.
- TypePause moved out: Whereas theTypePause event used to be a property of any Control, it has now been moved out to only TextBox and TextArea,in order to more accurately reflect its usage.

NEW FEATURES

- Leave method: Every Component now hasa Leave method which will Remove it from its Parent containingcollection.
- RemoveRange: A new method of theGroup and ArrayList classes which can Remove multiple objects with one call: RemoveRange. Analogously toAddRange, it accepts either an unlimited number of elements to be removed as separate parameters, or throughone parameter which is an array or implements Iterator (e.g.,ArrayList)

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Explicit set of $from to null in Animations sets to 0, not null: When calling Animate setting $from to null to get to later params has the same effect as setting $from to 0, rather than null.


NOLOH 1.7.510 - 1.7.513 posted Wed, Mar 24th, 2010 pm31 10:20 PM

IMPROVEMENTS OR BUG FIXES

- Improvements to OpenPrintableVersion(): Minor improvements made to Panel's OpenPrintableVersion. $openDialog parameter added. This parameter allows for automatic launching of the print dialog for the Panel's print contents.

NEW FEATURES

- Contents property of the Fileclass: Allows for easy reading and writing of a file.
- Functional Syntactic Sugar: Whenthere are no ambiguities, trying to get (either as a class variable or via a corresponding Get method) anobject's property which is also the name of one of its classes functions, it will return a new ServerEventinstance having that object as the Source and using that method name. Any parameters passed to the Get methodwill be used as the parameters for the ServerEvent (or none will be passed in if the class variable style ofgetting a property is used instead of the Get method.) An article clarifying this with examples as well asfurther discussion is forthcoming.

NEW FEATURES

- HTMLName Property: New HTMLName property that corresponds to the client's HTML name property. This is usually used in conjunction with the NOLOH Form Control, although it can also be used as an alternative or in addition to your CSS classes.
